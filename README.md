Weather Trend Forecasting Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of global weather trends using the Global Weather Repository dataset. The project leverages advanced data science techniques to clean, analyze, and forecast weather data, and includes multiple advanced analyses such as climate trend studies, environmental impact assessments, feature importance evaluation, spatial analysis, and exploration of geographical patterns.

Key Components

 •	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handling missing values, parsing dates, and preparing the data for analysis.
	
 •	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing daily temperature and precipitation trends to uncover initial insights.
	
 •	Forecasting Models:
Building and comparing ARIMA and Prophet models to forecast weather trends. An ensemble forecast is also implemented to improve accuracy.
	
 •	Advanced Analyses:
	
 •	Climate Analysis: Studying long-term climate patterns and seasonal variations across different regions.
	
 •	Environmental Impact: Analyzing correlations between weather parameters and air quality metrics.
	
 •	Feature Importance: Assessing which weather and air quality features most influence temperature predictions using techniques like Random Forest.
	
 •	Spatial Analysis: Visualizing weather conditions geographically using interactive maps.
	
 •	Geographical Patterns: Comparing weather conditions across countries and continents.
	
 •	PM Accelerator Mission:
The PM Accelerator mission is prominently featured in the project report, aligning our analytical approach with strategic project management and acceleration objectives.
